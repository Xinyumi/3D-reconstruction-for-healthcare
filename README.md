# 3D-reconstruction-for-healthcare
# Introduction
In the field of healthcare, 3D reconstruction is a critical technology that can be applied to various areas, such as woundï¼Œfoot ulcer and Polyp. In this project, we aim to utilize mobile devices to capture images and calculate the pose. Subsequently, advanced algorithms are employed to compute the reconstruction of the specific anatomical region of interest. This project incorporates various common technologies, including SLAM , NeRF, and MVS. These technologies play vital roles in the overall 3D reconstruction process.
